The notebook

LunarLander_generate.ipynb

is the place to start.  It generates the trajectories as movies and in the parquet format.  The parquet format is open source, fast, efficient in space, and available for both pandas (in python) and in Matlab!

The movies are in the mp4 format, which is also open source and widely available.
